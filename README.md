This repository provides python libraries for analyzing your expenses.

Current usage is limited to Sparda Bank CSV outputs.

If you are in Sparda Bank, get a CSV output of your expenses, then follow the rest of the code.

The whole thing needs refactoring (I know), but also re-organization for reading different data formats.
